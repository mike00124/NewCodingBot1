 I'm unable to directly access external content such as Figma designs or files. However, I can provide you with a general outline of how you might approach translating Figma designs into HTML/CSS layouts based on the provided requirements.

Here's a basic example of how you might structure your HTML/CSS code to match the Figma design:

HTML:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Responsive and Accessible Design</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Header content here -->
    </header>
    <nav>
        <!-- Navigation content here -->
    </nav>
    <main>
        <!-- Main content here -->
    </main>
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content here -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
CSS (styles.css):

css
Copy code
/* Reset styles */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Basic styling */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
}

nav {
    background-color: #666;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 10px;
}

main {
    padding: 20px;
}

footer {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 10px;
}
This is a very basic example to get you started. You would need to replace the placeholder content with the actual content from the Figma designs and adjust the CSS accordingly to match the styles specified in the designs.

For bonus points, you would need to make sure your design is responsive by using media queries in your CSS to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. Additionally, you would need to ensure accessibility by using semantic HTML elements, providing appropriate alt text for images, and making sure interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
